# Starchart 

Python program to generate star charts. Currently supports creating charts in the following projections:

*   stereographic - for generating atlas style maps covering large areas of sky.
*   gnomonic - for generating field of view type charts useful as finder charts.
*   polar - for generating a polar view.

The program uses data from the Tycho2 catalogue: <http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?I/259> and the Revised New General Catalogue: <http://www.klima-luft.de/steinicke/ngcic/rev2000/Explan.htm>.

There are quite a few options which are documented in the program:

   python chart.py -h
