# Starchart 

Python program to generate star charts. Currently supports creating charts in the following projections:

*   stereographic - for generating atlas style maps covering large areas of sky.
*   gnomonic - for generating field of view type charts useful as finder charts.
*   polar - for generating a polar view.

There are quite a few options which are documented in the program:

python chart.py -h
